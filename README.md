## Overview

This Face Recognition System uses a CNN model to identify faces in images. The model is trained using an image dataset, and data augmentation techniques are applied to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics on the training, validation, and test sets. The training process includes plotting accuracy and loss over time to visualize the model's performance.
